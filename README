This is an unstable, non-working experiment!

You will need a ccan directory: see http://ccodearchive.net. See README.ccan for further information.

Pettycoin also requires the following dependencies:

* openssl.h
* valgrind, used by unit testing

Thus, on a fresh Debian-based system you may need to do `apt-get install build-essential git libssl-dev valgrind` before starting.
(Tested under Xubuntu 13.04 amd64, Debian and 7.2 amd64, i386)

Good luck!
Rusty.
